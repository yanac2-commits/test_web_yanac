We didn’t have enough time in the lab to work on the join step together, but our plan is to use an inner_join() by the shared year variable. Before joining, we will clean both datasets to ensure the year column uses the same format and consistent naming. We also plan to check for missing values and convert year values to a numeric format if needed. This will allow us to accurately compare NYC income and cost‑of‑living data across the same years.
